annual national day parade on october 1 which people eagerly awaited mao zedong proclaims the founding of the people s republic of china in beijing on october 1 1949 weeks later however i was informed

successor had reportedly died in a plane crash while attempting to flee the country after a failed coup attempt china s achievements in the last 60 years have come in zigs and zags the best place to look back at what china went through in the past six decades is tiananmen or the gate of heavenly peace behind it lies the imperial palace or forbidden city where china s emperors used to live the emperor is now history but tiananmen remains beijing s political center it was on the tiananmen rostrum where chairman mao formally proclaimed the founding of the people s republic the chinese people have stood up he declared in a shrill hunanese accent for decades the whole nation followed mao loyally he emphasized political mobilization of the common man especially the peasantry in mao s ideology the chinese people found hope in a new china wherein citizens would always have a bowl of rice to eat and clothes to wear mao proved to be good at fighting but poor at governing he pushed sweeping socio economic initiatives and strident ideological campaigns often with disastrous results during two political campaigns in the late 1950s over 550 000 rightist intellectuals were persecuted and imprisoned the great leap forward led to widespread famine and the deaths of an estimated 30 million chinese in the late 1960s mao would again stand in the tiananmen rostrum to launch the cultural revolution there he rallied hundreds of thousands of young chinese the radical red guards who lionized him like a demi god to rebel is justified they proclaimed they rebelled against everything and wreaked havoc everywhere for ten years china was condemned to political turmoil and economic malaise perhaps the only factor that kept the country from total collapse was the people s incomparable resilience and their ability to chi ku eat bitterness or bear hardship mao s reign is also credited for positive changes he banned child brides and polygamy built beijing s first subway line and started a space program with china s first satellite launch in 1972 the people s republic of china replaced the republic of china taiwan in the united nations still for three decades under

landmark stands as a symbol of deng s bold open door policy in the early 1980s the first kentucky fried chicken outlet opened in beijing just a stone s throw away from mao s mausoleum today the fast food chain still does brisk business with a large portrait of founder colonel sanders hanging on the three story building not every chinese embraced deng s reform and open door policy old guards and conservatives in and outside the communist party accepted deng s reform policies but with a great deal of misgiving the backlash came to a boil in 1989 when tiananmen witnessed an outpouring of support for the students who called for freedom and democracy and more reform after six weeks of heady demonstrations the tiananmen movement was brutally suppressed see landmark moments in china s 60
